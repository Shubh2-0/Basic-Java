# Basic-Java

Data types are different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable that is made as per convenience and circumstances to cover up all test cases. Also, let us cover up other important ailments that there are majorly two types of languages that are as follows:

1.First, one is a Statically typed language where each variable and expression type is already known at compile time. Once a variable is declared to be of a certain data type, it cannot hold values of other data types. For example C, C++, Java.

2.The other is Dynamically typed languages. These languages can receive different data types over time. For example Ruby, Python.


Java is ** statically typed and also a strongly typed language ** because, in Java, each type of data (such as integer, character, hexadecimal, packed decimal, and so forth) is predefined as part of the programming language and all constants or variables defined for a given program must be described with one of the data types.

Java has two categories in which data types are segregated

** Primitive Data Type: ** such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double
** Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type: ** such as String, Array, etc.

Primitive data are only single values and have no special capabilities. There are 8 primitive data types. They are depicted below in tabular format below as follows:

                                                               # Non-Primitive Data Type or Reference Data Types
                                                               
The Reference Data Types will contain a memory address of variable values because the reference types wonâ€™t store the variable value directly in memory. They are strings, objects, arrays, etc.
