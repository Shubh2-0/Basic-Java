# Basic Java 📚🚀

This repository contains basic Java programs and examples covering various concepts of object-oriented programming and fundamental Java topics. It serves as a beginner's guide to Java programming. 📖🎨

Java has two categories in which data types are segregated

**Primitive Data Type:** such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double\
**Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type:** such as String, Array, etc.

 
# Types Of Primitive Data Types
Primitive data are only single values and have no special capabilities. There are 8 primitive data types. They are depicted below in tabular format below as follows:

# Non-Primitive Data Type or Reference Data Types
                                                               
The Reference Data Types will contain a memory address of variable values because the reference types won’t store the variable value directly in memory. They are strings, objects, arrays, etc.
